Thanks so much for the screenshots — they're incredibly helpful, and now I can see **exactly** what's happening.

---

### ✅ Here's the issue:

In your screenshot (Code tab), your `README.md` **only contains 26 lines**, and it **stops right after the first code block**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

But the full README I gave you is over **80 lines long**. So:

> ✅ You're only pasting part of the full content — probably just the top section — and not the rest of it.

---

### 🛠 Fix It Step-by-Step (Right in GitHub)

1. Go to your repo → click `README.md` → click the ✏️ **Edit** button
2. **Delete everything**
3. **Copy the full text below (scroll all the way to the end!)**
4. Paste it in the GitHub editor
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

### ✅ The Full Working `README.md` (Copy All of This)

````markdown
# 🎨 Lifo Pic Project

Transform your headshot into a **cartoonish lofi aesthetic** using Python, OpenCV, and Pillow.

This project applies:
- 🖍️ Cartoon-style edge detection  
- 🔥 Warm color toning  
- ✨ Grain + vignette overlays for that cozy lofi vibe

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Convert portraits into cartoon-style images  
- Apply warm tones reminiscent of vintage/lofi art  
- Add grain and vignette for texture and focus  

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Contents of `requirements.txt`:

```text
opencv-python
Pillow
numpy
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script from terminal:

```bash
python lifo_pic_proj.py input.jpg output.jpg
```

### ✅ Example

```bash
python lifo_pic_proj.py picproj.jpg picproj_lofi.jpg
```

The transformed image will be saved as `picproj_lofi.jpg`.

```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Cartoonify image with OpenCV (edge detection + bilateral filters)
2. Convert to PIL for fine-tuning:

   * Warm color transform
   * Add random grain (like film)
   * Apply soft vignette for focus

### 💡 Tip

When copying:
- Make sure you **start at the very top** (`# 🎨 Lifo Pic Project`)
- And copy all the way down to the **final three backticks** (` ``` ` after "MIT License")
